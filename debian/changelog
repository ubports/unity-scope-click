    Show the price in the Buy button. (LP: #1258519)
  * Don't reimplement generated rules for vala. Take advantage of
    VALA_CHECK_MODULES to find vala packages. Split non-compatible
    mdoules to another PKG_CHECK_MODULES. Build majority of the code as
    a noinst lib, which click-scope and tests link to. Update the
    .bzrignore for an autools project. . (LP: #1258559)

    script. Move the contents of gcov.m4 to acinclude.m4 and remove the
    m4 directory. (LP: #1258177, #1257466)

    depends on libsecret-dev as we don't use it any longer. Simplify the
    vcs-bzr URL to just be the lp:unity-scope-click alias. (LP:
    #1261852)
  * Use $PROTOCOLPRIVATELIBDIR as $libdir may not be set to same path
    during build. (LP: #1262327)
  * Remove test_available_apps to avoid network access, and as the rest
    of the search() code is already tested in other tests. (LP:
    #1262364)
  * Replace the webservice object on the scope to avoid network access.
    (LP: #1262821)
  * Add dependency on ubuntu-purchase-service. Update the control file
    with wrap-and-sort -a -t.
